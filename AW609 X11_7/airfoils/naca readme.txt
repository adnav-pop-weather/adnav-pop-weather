High Efficiency Subsonic Airfoil (v9+)

Upper Surface profile: NACA 66-415 (modified)
Lower Surface profile: NACA 63A-820 (modified)
Profile modifications: parabolic leading edge, trailing edge profile modified

This is a good airfoil for modern (post-1945) subsonic aircraft with high wing loadings. Large regions of laminar flow are present at most angles of attack.

Lift/drag ratio is very high at small angles of attack, but the airfoil also provides good maximum lift (Cl ~1.8) with a moderate stall angle (13 degrees).
The stall is gentle, with a slow rate of lift loss and a tendency to pitch down sharply after the stall; departure should not be a problem at low sweep angles.
Nose down pitching moment is also not excessive, and the Cm-alpha curve is very flat despite the high camber, so it should give pleasant flying characteristics.
The zero-lift angle of attack is ~5 degrees nose-down; given the flat drag curve it should be easy to tune the wing for efficient cruise at a wide range of design points.

Only one reynolds number profile is provided, but testing in JavaFoil indicates the polars are largely constant from about 5 million to 50 million Re, changes being within reasonable margins of error for X-Plane.

The section is 15.7% thick with maximum thickness somewhere around 45% chord. Considerable volume is available across the chord, providing efficient storage for wheel wells, landing gear, and control surfaces--excepting that the trailing edge has a sharp cusp starting around 85% chord.

A reference image and X/Y coordinates are provided (see attached text file) for detailed modeling.

Polars were produced in JavaFoil.
